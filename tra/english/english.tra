@20000 = ~Long Sword~
@20001 = ~These swords are usually referred to as double-edged swords, war swords, or military swords. In many cases, the long sword has a single-edged blade. There is no single version of the long sword; the design and length vary from culture to culture and may vary within the same culture depending on the era. Among the most common characteristics of all long swords is their length, which ranges from thirty-five inches to forty-seven inches. In the latter case, the blade is known to take up forty inches of the total length. Most long swords have a double-edged blade and a sharp point at the tip. Despite the tip, the long sword is designed for slashing, not thrusting.

@20190 = ~Dear Greenbough Publishing,

I write to rectify the confusion in which your last missive was apparently sent. Your reply in regards to my next manuscript, "Adventuring With All Your Limbs Attached: Both There And Back Again" is my latest treatsie on the adventuring mage's life. As the greatest first-level mage who has ever lived (so far), my musings and experiences are of considerable value to both the novice and seasoned adventurer. Not only is my writing style light and entertaining to read, but the contents of my manuscript could save many lives.

You understand my confusion, then, when I recieved your reply that your line of comedic tomes was full for this year and to try again in future seasons. Please check your informative travelogue lineup and respond at your earliest convenience.

Sincerely,

Alveus Malcanter~
@20191 = ~Alveus Note 02~
@20192 = ~(This parchment has been torn at the top. It seems to have been ripped from a larger piece.)

Rule Three: Taverns can be of great use for surviving an adventure. Before venturing into that dank tomb or bleak dungeon, visit the local tavern. Buy lots of drinks. Soon your party will be merrily singing and drinking the night away. While they sleep off their excesses the next morning, you can quietly leave town.

Rule Four: Some will tell you that second-level spells are necessary for a successful career. Don't believe them! With great power comes great responsibility, so if you stick to first-level spells, no one will expect you to stick your neck out into a dangerous situation.

Rule Five: A mage is only as good as their robe. Though you may never rival my exquisite collection of Faerûn's finest robes (may? I am too humble. None could rival that collection of finery), you would do well to obtain a quality tailor at the first opportunity.

Remember, with intelligence, discretion, and an overwhelming, shrieking, constant fear of death, you too can be a successful adventuring mage!~
@20193 = ~Alveus Note 03~
@20194 = ~Potential Aphorisms

A green slime in the hand is worth nothing, and also you now have no hand. Wear gloves at all times.

A statue is just a potential gargoyle. Carry a statue-poking stick and give it to someone in heavy armor.

A pocketful of gold is good; a sackful of gold is better. But carrying a huge sack of gold makes it hard to run away, so a bag of holding is a good investment.

Something about bacon? "Your bacon's in the fire" is bad, but bacon is also delicious...

@20196 = ~(This note is titled "Advice to a Novice Mage.")

If you are reading this, then you are, perhaps, a young mage just starting out on your career. You might aspire to the heights of some of the greatest wizards in Faerûn. "Elminster," you think to yourself. "Blackstaff. Malcanter."

NO, not Malcanter! You chuckle at your foolishness. Who could ever compete with the greatest first-level mage to have ever lived (so far)?

I am here to tell you that while, in truth, you cannot hope to ever acquire the seasoned and respected name I have made for myself, you can at least hope to reach the plateau from which my shadow seems just slightly less long and chilly as it envelops you. If you follow my advice, you will be well on your way to becoming a second-rate imitation of myself.

Rule One: There are some that believe taking credit for a job well done is the easiest way to build a reputation. But taking credit for a job someone ELSE did well and is now dead so they can't contradict you anyway is, in fact, more effic—

– Always stay at the back of the party. Monsters rarely attack from the rear.

– Middle, Middle is good too. Surround yourself with hulking companions in full plate armor.

(Here follows a doodle of a stick figure in a pointy hat surrounded by armored individuals carrying enormous swords.)

– Can also follow way behind group. Say one hundred yards. Cast spells from a distance and join in when the looting begins.

– Perhaps one mile behind party? They can scream if they need help.

(The next few points are scratched out.)

– Could just stay home.~
@20201 = ~Alveus Note 07~
@20202 = ~My Dearest Agythi,

It was with no little joy that I received your missive. Corresponding with those who have read my books and learning how my advice has positively affected their lives is a source of great pleasure for me. That you were able to write such a letter without the use of your arms makes the feat even more impressive—I suspect in the future you will take my oft-repeated mantra "Do not wrestle an angry ogre, or indeed any ogre, if it can be avoided" to heart.

I gather from your note that you found my words less useful than one might have hoped when it came to the matter of the ogre wrestling. I have some questions regarding the events that led to such an unfortunate happenstance:

1) How did you come to find yourself in amongst a pack of savage, bloodthirsty ogres? Over the years, I have offered many suggestions and strategies designed to help the prudent adventurer avoid just such a situation as this. If nothing else, my advice regarding the fortifying of one's home and the frequency with which one leaves it (my advice being "never"), if followed, should have prevented such a circumstance as this from ever occurring.

2) Who challenged whom to the wrestling match? I do hope that it was the ogre's idea, as I'm quite certain the flaws in such a scheme originating from your side of the equation have become painfully self-evident.

3) Had you ever considered a profession that carries with it slightly less risk of having one's arms torn off by a redblooding great ogre? Those who aren't cut out for adventure will often find themselves torn from it if they fail to act with the appropriate level of caution. Though they lack the potential glory a lucky few are able to wrest from a life of exploration and action, there is no shame whatsoever in fulfilling the role of a farmer, a courtesan, a tailor, or any number of other, more banal occupations. Someone has to shine my boots, after all.

However you came to this regrettable state, I hope you will take some solace in the enclosed copy of my latest book. As you are a reader of my work, I have signed the volume and shall have the messenger take ten percent off the price I generally charge. May you find some enlightenment or entertainment in its pages during your period of convalescence.

Yours very truly,
Alveus Malcanter~

The bard, despite being outnumbered, threw herself at the hunters and fought them valiantly while the unicorn escaped. The hunters beat the bard near to death and left her broken body on the ground. Moments after they left, the unicorn stepped softly to the bard and extended its horn. The bard grasped the horn weakly and, to her astonishment, it came away in her hand. The bard sat up, healed of all wounds and bestowed with a valuable gift. The unicorn vanished into the trees, and the bard found the horn bestowed healing powers whenever she played it.

Zachiira survived the encounter, but sadly her triumphal return was met with rather less celebration and rather more grief, as the good king was already dead when she arrived.

At the next lecture, the pupil stood up and shouted, "I won't listen to you any longer!" To his horror, no sound issued from his throat.

All his burglaries were undertaken with prayers to Mask, and he hoarded his stolen goods at a hidden altar to the god of thieves. He favored purple clothing, believing it was a color the god preferred, and he crafted this belt to match his ensemble. The thief was eventually caught and killed on one of his missions and the belt confiscated by the city guard. The next night, the belt vanished from a locked chest in the guardhouse, though, whisked away by Mask so that it could continue to serve the god's ends.

Unfortunately—and it took Mosela only a few short days to discover this—Listrom knew more about making the golems than he did about controlling them, and by the end of Mosela’s first week she realized that she would need some means of protecting herself. Thus was created this cudgel that, she hoped, would keep the misbehaving constructs at bay. When Listrom lost what little sanity he had, Mosela discovered that her invention worked just as well on raving lunatics.

"Oh, shocked from the strike of his powerful bow,
The slain game sought by Adaniss falls.
Long ago in the time of the Quiet Earth,
The hunt from the famed High Forest calls.

"The Duke of Everlund known for his boast
Of the trophies held in his pride as dear.
Intensely enraged at his rival hunter
Whose bounty by far surpassed his one year.

"One morn tragedy befell the land
With the misconceived death of the Duke's prized hound.
Fallen at the base of a great elm tree
A bow's shot death in its heart was found.

"With skill so great targets in his eyes were at the mercy of his arrow's flight.
His hands sure and still,
Never missing a kill,
None could match the marksmanship of Adaniss Rhyte.

"The same eve Adaniss called on the Duke,
His solemn mistake he wished to repay.
But the noble's rage claimed ten pounds of flesh
And an archer's arm hit the ground that day.

"The evil lord demanded justice unjust
The most vile curse on his arm to be cast.
Vengeance he sought for the price he had paid
Rhyte vowed the hound's arrow not to be his last.

"In sorrow the town helped him forge an axe
Blessed to honor his most glorious day.
With the mark of Rhyte's arrow to guide its strike
And reputed to kill in the very same way.

"With skill so great targets in his eyes were at the mercy of his arrow's flight.
His hands sure and still,
Never missing a kill,
None could match the marksmanship of Adaniss Rhyte.

"Again called the forest with its precious game,
And a prize Adaniss with thrill did he seek.
But none could be finer than the great clawed falcon
Sought by all amidst the forest's Lost Peaks.

"Once more the rivalry of the Duke did stir,
For he thought of his skills with Rhyte's bow to be best.
And set his sights on the glorious bird
To emerge as the holder of its sainted crest.

"The two climbed the peaks and searched days on end,
Each of their wills set as strong as the stone.
They found each other at a cliff by chance;
Both of their hatreds ran as deep as the bone.

"With skill so great targets in his eyes were at the mercy of his arrow's flight.
His hands sure and still,
Never missing a kill,
None could match the marksmanship of Adaniss Rhyte.

"The Duke drew the bow and pulled the string taut,
But first flew Adaniss's axe with its blow.
Cleaved, the lord stumbled to cliff's edge and off,
Defeated by Rhyte's last arrow...

"With skill so great targets in his eyes were at the mercy of his arrow's flight.
His hands sure and still,
Never missing a kill,
None could match the marksmanship of Adaniss Rhyte.
None could match the marksmanship of Adaniss Rhyte."

When his body was carried to the Iron Tower, Thel’blax’s horns and barbs continued to thrash about as though alive.

The cursed cornugon’s body was dismantled by his peers, in the hopes that destroying him would end the curse; but the disparate pieces of Thel’blax’s body continued to prick and tear at any who approached. At last, Dispater ordered his ironsmiths to forge the pieces into a suit of armor, intending to use it as a means of torturing insubordinates. Inevitably, the armor fell into the hands of intrepid (if foolhardy) adventurers, who then brought the piece to Faerûn.

Even now, the curse of Thel’blax affects the armor, causing its barbs to sink painfully into the flesh of anyone wearing it. It provides a measure of protection, behaving like hide armor, and even allows the wearer to benefit from Thel’blax’s resilience; but the constant stinging and flaying from the cornugon’s still-living barbs make this armor unsuitable for the faint of heart or the weak of stomach.

Pelham eventually enchanted Owain's Lullabye for the bard in exchange for a small sum of money. Owain rarely used the instrument in battle, typically employing it when he found late-migrating geese lounging on a lake. He would blow the horn in such a way that the geese heard it as the sound of their cousins heading south for the winter. As the geese would attempt to take flight, Owain's horn would freeze them in mid-stroke, where he would leave them to die.

With the aid of the cittern, he helped the Company of Frozen Trees defeat a young green dragon in 1013 DR.

The bandits killed and severely injured many of the pilgrims, and they cut the strings of Sephica's harp when she tried to soothe the injured travelers. After the bandits had left, Sephica prayed to Ilmater for help in a time of crisis. When she plucked at her harp strings with her eyes closed in prayer, music miraculously poured forth and healed every person who heard it. The next day, the bandits arrived and killed Sephica for healing the pilgrims. Though she was killed, the pilgrims kept the memory of her miracle alive.

Kay made dozens of enemies everywhere he went because of his acidic wit and appetite for confrontation. Sages believe that Milil frowned upon Pellon's antics, but that Talos found Pellon's attitude to be quite amusing. The avatar of Talos watched Pellon start a fight with over twenty men in a bar one night. As a gift for such destructive entertainment, Talos touched the lute that was laying next to Pellon's unconscious body. After that night, Pellon discovered that he could make men go berserk just by playing his lute in their direction. He took great delight in setting mercenaries and sailors against each other for several weeks. Eventually, Pellon Kay was laid low by a grim-featured warrior with a crossbow who didn't let Pellon get close enough to employ his magical lute. The unknown warrior threw the lute into the Sea of Fallen Stars.

@20402 = ~This cursed item was created by the wicked sorcerer Valom of the Deep. Valom often hired lone mercenaries to collect magic item components for him. When the unlucky sellswords came on board Valom's floating laboratory, the Dim Courser, Valom would give them the girdle as a reward for a job well done. Once the victim would try on the girdle, Valom would kick them over the side of the boat, where they would quickly drown. Valom's luck ran out when he kicked Herred of Procampur into the Sea of Fallen Stars. Herred had a potion of water breathing and a helm of underwater action with him at the time. When the huge, seaweed-covered form of Herred emerged near the docks where Valom was resting, a local priest of Tyr immediately came to his aid. Upon discovering what Valom had done, the priest of Tyr and three paladins attempted to capture him. Valom killed two of the paladins, but died in the battle. It is believed that the belt was later sold to a traveling collector who specialized in cursed clothing.

The cloak twists in torchlight, each strand of hair raveling and unraveling about the others so subtly that it appears as if a light breeze is rippling the cloak.

This cloak is woven from the hair of virgins sent to the Burial Isle to sleep with their dead barbarian lords. It was the Seer's duty to comfort these women, to soothe their pain—in order to do so, she took a lock of hair from each and wove the strands into a cloak that would draw the spirits of fear from the virgins and steady their hearts. The result was a cloak that hangs heavy with guilt and does little to shield the wearer from the cold of the North.

When worn, the hairs weave around the wielder's frame, the long strands lacing together like threads on a loom. The cloak will not willingly unravel itself from a wearer without being coerced by a Remove Curse spell.

Zilzanzer was petrified over a dozen times, each time being brought back by his faithful assistant's use of Stone to Flesh scrolls. Zilzanzer eventually decided that he should make an item to protect him from petrification. The result was the Ring of the Gorgon. Sages believe that Beshaba must have smiled upon Zilzanzer when he was born, for he was turned to stone when he put on the ring. His assistant dutifully read the Stone to Flesh scroll, bringing Zilzanzer out of his stone form. Unfortunately, Zilzanzer died in the process, this time forever.

@20419 = ~Fiery Vengance +3~
@20420 = ~Im 1208DR, Blasille Ikretti, a paladin squire in the service of Mystra, had returned to her homestead after months-long training in the frozen north.  Shortly after her arrival, an insidious Ogre Magi that had been conducting surreptitous raids on the local towns targetted Blasille's home as his next conquest.  Under the cover of night, he struck.  Blasille fought as hard as she could, but was no match for the Ogre's magery.  She was captured, and forced to watch as one, by one, her friends and family were slaughtered.  The saddistic ogre took great pleasure in killing each of them slowly, while Blasille could do nothing.  For three days and nights, she was forced to witness this horror, pleading with her Goddess for help... but none came.

on the fourth night, utterly broken, consumed by sorrow and rage, she made one final plea:  "Gods!  To any who would listen, hear me!  I will pay any price, bear any burden, suffer any curse, serve any master, if you will but grant me the power to destroy this fiend and avenge my fallen!".  Her cry was heard.  In her hands, where once was held a fragment of a shattered holy symbol, was now the hilt of a weapon unlike anything she had ever seen.  Blasille then heard what sounded like a faint whisper: "It's strength, from yours".  Paying the cryptic message no heed, she gripped it tightly, as a blazing blue blade sprang from it.  It sliced through her iron shackles as if they were no more than parchment paper.  With a soul-shattering cry, she charged at the Ogre Magi whom had decimated her home and family.  The Ogre's haughty scowl soon gave way to a look of panic, as Blasille swatted each of his spells back at him as she approached.  With two swift strokes, Blasille bi-sected and be-headed the Ogre, spitting on his carcass before leaving it for the crows to feast on.

Blasille then collapsed.  As she lay, utterly spent, her skin pale,she understood.  Her life-force is what had given the weapon it's power, and as she drew her last breath, the blade retreated back into the hilt and went dark.  Vengance had been granted, and the price for it, paid.

His winning streak wouldn't last long, however.  During a scheduled fight with a elderly gladiator that Kilgore had assumed he'd have an easy victory over, he was brought low in short order.

He wanted to share his enthusiam with his fellow dwarves, and set about learning to sing and play from elf musicians.  The elves were a bit apprehensive at first, as they'd never heard of a dwarven bard, but nevertheless they took him under their tutelage.  Unfortunately, despite his best efforts, whenever he would perform what he had learned, the dwarves of the deep would only laugh and likened his song to that of a bleating goat.  Others would disparage his efforts by shouting: "Ye cannae even carry an axe, much less a tune!"

Undeterred, Kurg sought help from one of his elven tutors, and the two set about forging an enchanted hand axe that would reverberate with Kurg's voice when he sang into it, resulting in the most unique and melodic tone.  At his next performance, the dwarves were both shocked and utterly delighted, marvelling at how such a wondeful sound could be produced with an axe as an instrument.  During the last days of the Deep, as the dwarves struggled against the invading orcish hordes, Kurg's song enfused them with courage and strength, allowing them to fight longer and harder than they would have been otherwise.

To this day, Kurg's disembodied voice can sometimes still be heard in the halls, bellowing a doleful dirge.

One would expect a club of stone to be very heavy and unwieldy, but the enchantments lighten it to mostly that of an average wooden club for the wielder.  Recipients of strikes from the weapon, however, aren't as fortunate.  These same magics also keep the basilisk eye somewhat alive.

@20439 = ~Gold Rush +3~
@20440 = ~Around 1103DR, in a small mining village nestled deep within the Spine of the World, rumors had been circulating for months of sightings of an extremely rare greater gold elemental.  It was speculated that it was disturbed by miners who had dug too greedily, and too deep, and any miner unfortunate enough to encounter it within the tunnels met with a swift end.  Naturally, these rumors drew many adventureres to the small town, seeking to find and slay the creature, as it's golden carcass would surely be worth a sizeable fortune.  Many came, spelunking through the twisting caverns of the mine, but none ever returned.

In truth, there was no lurking gold elemental in the mines.  A few years prior, the gold and all other valuable minerals from the mine had completely dried up, and the towspeople were desperate to save their home.  They took what valuables they had remaining and traded them to a very talented gnomish tinkerer and mage to create a "golden" golem which they could use to lure those seeking fame and fortune to their town and reap the rewards of all their spent coin in the local shops.  The golem itself was made of pyrite, commonly known as fool's gold, and fashioned to look like an elemental.  It was thought that in the dark of the mines, no one would be able to tell the difference, and since the golem would slay any it met in the depths, there would be none to tell the tale anyhow.

For a time, the ruse worked well and the village prospered.  This would not last, however.  Eventually, an expedition from Waterdeep was sent after word had reached the faraway city.  The Waterdhavians were well-seasoned and prepared, and when they finally located the golem, they were able to bring it low.  Upon discovery of the treachery, the townspeople were forced to return with the expedition and face corporal punishment for their evil deed, which resulted in the loss of many innocent lives.

Of the golem itself, found within the heap of it's body was an extremely dense, softly glowing golden orb that had served as it's power core.  It was far too dense and hard to be real gold, yet seemed to have all of it's properties, alongside the latent enchantments it possessed.  Being the only thing of value found by the expedition, it was brought back to Waterdeep and presented to the Lords of the city.  After puzzling over what to do with it, one of the Lords requesitioned it to be used in the crafting of an exquisite mace.  The mace was then presented to a high priestess of Waukeen as a gift in return for her god's favor and blessing over the entire city.

Decades later, after the mace had changed many hands within the church, it was carried into it's first real battle by a cleric named Dunhaven Winterborne.  Dunhaven noticed that when he would bash in the heads of his foes with the mace, a number of gold coins would fall out to the ground, seemingly from nowhere.  Dunhaven, both bewildered and amazed by this, quickly scooped them up and moved onto his next opponent.  It wasnt long before the greed that tends to follow large amounts of gold consumed him, and others took notice.  The next day, Dunhaven, along with many of his comrades were found slain in their tents, and the mace nowhere to be found.  In the years since, it has passed through many hands, and now finds itself in yours....but for how long?

Saberra, a half-orc of immense size and strength, always carried her favored weapon, a massive halberd, into battle whether she was on foot, or mounted.  With reckless abandon would she charge into fights, with little to no regard for her opponent's skill or size.  She would thrust and swing wildly with each stroke, fueled by insatiable rage and bloodlust.  One would expect such a fighting style to lead to an early death, but not for Saberra.  Old age and disease would be her only defeat.  As a final request, Saberra asked her lifelong friend, an elder shaman, to perform a ritual to transfer her soul into her favorite tool of conquest, so that she could, in spirit, continue to fight side-by-side with future generations.

This spell draws forth a massive bolt of electrical energy from the plane of air into the prime, striking the caster's target and nearby foes with a surge of eletricity. Each bolt causes 12d8 points of electrical damage, plus an additional 1d8 points per level of the caster, up to a maximum of 21d8. Any creatures within a 7 foot radius are also caught in the blast and take 4d8 of electrical damage, plus 1d8 per two levels up to a maximum of 8d8.  The force of the blast knocks affected targets back and unconscious for one round.  Creatures may make a reflex save to evade the blast, or successfully Save vs. Spell to halve the damage.~

Trollkiller's Fireball is a more powerful version of the level 3 wizard spell, Fireball.  It's namesake, Durlag Trollkiller, commissioned an exiled elven mage of considerable skill to create this spell for use in eradicating trolls from his homeland.  Much to his delight, the creation of the spell was successful and put to great use during his troll-cleansing campaign.  In the years following, as Durlag's madness took hold of him, he kept all of his most prized possessions, including this spell, under lock, key, and devious trap inside his tower.  How it came to be in your possession is a mystery.   When cast, a raging ball of flame flies forth from the caster's hand, striking the target point and exploding in a horrific display of hellfire, doing 1d6 points of damage for each level of the spellcaster (up to a maximum of 16d6) to targets caught in the blast.  The searing heat is so intense that it can ignite clothing, armor, and even flesh, causing an additional 1d4 fire damage per round and sending the afflicted into a state of panic until they successfully roll a Save vs. Spell to extinguish the flames.  Those who roll successful a Save vs. Spell manage to dodge, fall flat, or roll aside, taking only half damage from the inital blast, and evade the ongoing fire damage and panic.  All saving throws must be made at -2.~

The chosen of Auril speak of this spell as legend, a power that the Ice Maiden bestows only upon her most favored, and is a closely guarded secret.  It is said this spell conjures forth the very breath of Auril herself.  Cold as the hearts of Auril's followers may be, there are beings far, far more cruel than they in the realms, and it is rumored that one such being, known as "The Shattered One", caputured a high priestess of Auril and performed torturous experiments on her to "extract" this magic for his own use.  Unfortunately for the mage, he was unable to channel the divine energies required for the spell to work properly.  However, the damage was done and the secrets of this magic were shared across the realms, much to Auril's displeasure.  This spell brings forth a gale of icy, frozen wind from the caster's hands, feezing all in it's path with 1d5+1 of cold damage per level, up to a maximum of 20d5+20.   Those afflicted by the blistering cold are frozen in their tracks, hindering their ability to fight unless a saving throw is made.   Those who roll a successful Save vs. Spell will shrug off a portion of the cold, taking half damage and avoid being frozen in place.  All saving throws must be made at -2.  The use of this spell by non-aurilites angers the Ice Maiden greatly and there is a small chance that an enraged golem of ice will form from the gale and attack the party.~

Creatures caught in the area of effect will take 1d10 of acid damage per round that they remain in the caustic fog, and must roll a Saving Throw vs. Spells at a -4 penalty or suffer reduction to their resistances against all forms of physical damage 15% for three rounds.

This ability allows Anomen to hurl a bolt of divine energy at an enemy once per day, dealing them 5d6 points of magic damage.

Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

This spell works only on player characters or allied creatures.  When cast, fell, demonic energies are channeled into the target causing them to go berserk, attacking the nearest creature until that creature is dead, then moving on to the next target. While under the effects of Fell Rage, the target is immune to charm, sleep, fear, hold, stunning, confusion, emotion, symbol spells, and related effects. In addition, the target gains +1 to hit, +1 to Strength, +1 to Dexterity, +1 to Constitution, +10 to maximum Hit Points, +2 to <PRO_HISHER> movement rate, 5% Physical Damage Resistance, 30% Fire Resistance, and 1d2 Damage(Acid) to all physical attacks. The spell has several disadvantages, however: The Hit Points of the target are masked for the duration of the spell, and at the end of the spell's duration, the target becomes fatigued and <PRO_HISHER> Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution are reduced by 3 for 2 turns. Fell Rage cannot be cast by or affect creatures of good alignment.~

This spell conjures forth shadowy orbs of dark energy from the shadow plane that bolt forward from the caster's hand to strike <PRO_HISHER> target with unerring precision. The priest creates one bolt at 9th level and an additional bolt at every third level after 9th—in other words, two bolts at 12th level, three at 15th, four at 18th, to a maximum of five bolts at 21st level. Each bolt inflicts 1d5 points of cold damage and 1d5 points of magic damage to the target and then bursts in a 5-ft. radius concussive blast that inflicts 6 points of cold damage and 6 points of magic damage, increasing by two points each per every 3 levels of the caster, up to a maximum of 14 per each at level 21.  Addtionally, creatures caught in the dark energy blast suffer a 20% chance of being blinded for one turn or being drained of one level permanently. Creatures can attempt a Save vs. Spell at -4 to negate the concussion damage and effects, but the impact of the bolts themselves allow no Saving Throw.  Undead creatures are immune to the effects of this spell.  Priests of good alignment may not cast this spell.~

When this spell is cast, the caster is enshrouded by dark shadows, taking on the form of a shadow fiend.  While in this form, <PRO_HESHE> takes on some of the abilities of a shadow monster:  Movement rate is increased by 2, casting speed is increased by 2, attack rate is increased by 1/2 per round, resistance to all physical attacks is increased by 7%, resistances to fire, cold, acid, and magic attacks are increased by 20%, the caster is able to hide and stay hidden in shadows with ease, and <PRO_HISHER> movement cannot be impeded by normal means.  However, the inherent weakness of a shadow monster is also imparted to the caster, and <PRO_HISHER> becomes extremely susceptible to electrical attacks for the duration of the spell.~

Ko'Dezza was an eccentric half-drow mage who lived before the time of troubles.  She attempted to create new spells by modifying and enhancing existing spells.  While her experiements met with failure more often than not, this spell was on her more successful efforts.  For all intents and purposes, this spell functions very similar to the level 3 spell, Fireball, except that two or more fireballs are launched simultaneously, and home in on a targetted creature with unerring accuracy.  When this spell is cast, two fireballs are launched at a target, and upon impact, explode in a horrific display of flames, doing 6d6 damage to the target and all creatures within a 15 foot radius of the impact.  For every two levels of the caster, damage is increased by 1d6 up to a maximum of 10d6 at level 22, and for every four levels an additional fireball is launched, up to a maximum of four at level 22.  Thus, a level 22 wizard can fire four fireballs each doing 10d6 fire damage at level 22. As with the level 3 spell, Fireball, creatures who make a Saving Throw per fireball may reduce their damage taken from it by half.  Creatures weak against fire would do well to steer clear of a mage with this spell in <PRO_HISHER> repetoire.~

When this spell is cast, acrid pools of thick, corrosive ichor rise from the earth and cover the ground.  Any creatures entering the area or caught in it when the spell is cast are mired in the sticky substance, which severly hinders their movement while corroding their flesh and armor, doing 1d4 damage(acid) per round, and reducing their physical resistances by 5%, making them more susceptible to melee and ranged attacks.  For every three levels of the caster, damage is increased by one point, and physical resistance is reduced by an additional percentage point, up to a maximum of 1d4+5 and 10%, respectively.  A successful Save vs. Spell at -2 negates the slowed movement and reduced defenses, while halving damage for that round.~

Creatures affected suffer 1d4 piercing and 1d4 cold damage per round, increasing by 1 point each for every three levels of the caster, up to a maximum of 1d4+2 cold and 1d4+2 piercing.  Affected creatures must roll a Save vs. Paralyze at -4 or be paralyzed for one and a half rounds.  Creatures that make a saving throw avoid being paralyzed and reduce their damage taken by one half.

Ko'Dezza, an eccentric half-drow mage who lived around 1260DR, attempted to create new spells by experimenting with modifying and combining components of existing spells.  More often than not, her attempts met with unmitigated disater, but this spell was one of her more successful ventures.  Upon casting this spell, the wizard summons forth several slime creatures that pool and coagulate into one monstrous, gelatinous golem.  This golem possesses all the strengths of a slime monster, being very resistant to most physical attacks.  However, it also shares the weaknesses of these creatures and is quite vulnerable to fire and acid attacks.  The summoned golem will obey the commands of it's summoner for four rounds, plus one additional round per level of the caster, or until it is destroyed.  There is a 10% chance when casting this spell that two slime golems will be summoned instead of one.~

When this spell is cast, the very earth shakes and is torn asunder sending gouts of flame up from the cracks. The cataclysm affects all creatures in its area of effect, occuring in three waves:

 1st: All creatures affected take 3d6 points of crushing damage, and 3d6 points of fire damage.  Affected creatures are also knocked to the ground, panicked, or go berserk for four rounds.  A successful Saving Throw vs. Spell with a -6 penalty halves the damage and negates the adverse effects.
 2nd: All creatures affected take 1d9 points of crushing damage, and 1d9 points of fire damage.  A successful Saving Throw vs. Spell with a -2 penalty halves the damage.
 3rd: All creatures affected take 1d6 points of crushing damage, and 1d6 points of fire damage.  A successful Saving Throw vs. Spell halves the damage.

This spell will affect both friend and foe alike, so great care must be taken in its use. Finally, earth and fire elementals are angered by the careless sundering and there is a small chance that casting this spell will cause one to appear and attack the party.~

There is a 15% chance per round that affected creatures will be frozen solid and unable to move for three rounds, while being frozen from the inside out.

The barrier reduces damage from all attacks by 10%, increasing by an additional percentage point every two levels to a maximum of 15% at level 21.  Additionally, creatures who successfully hit the caster through the shadowy barrier within melee range suffer 1d5 points of magic damage and 1d5 points of cold damage, with a 20% change of being drained of one level as well.

So deadly is this poison as to instantly slay creatures of 8 or fewer Hit Dice, and creatures with 9 or 10 Hit Dice must roll a Saving Throw vs. Poison at -8 for each round they remain in the area of effect, lest they be slain instantly as well.

While remaining in the area of effect, there is a 25% chance per round that creatures will also be systemically poisoned, suffering an additional 2 Hit Points of poison damage per second for 2 rounds, unless they make a Saving Throw vs. poison at -8.

Creatures struck by the boulder can roll a Save vs. Spell to sidestep or jump out of the way at the last moment to halve the damage, there is no Saving Throw allowed to avoid the chance of being crushed to death.

When cast, the spell conjures forth a mass of living slime that encapsulates the caster in a protective bubble.  The slime-shell is highly corrosive, and thwarts acidic and physical attacks.

The missiles home in on their target with unerring accuracy and collide, resulting in a horrific explosion sending molten shrapnel and frozen shards flying outward in a 15-ft. radius, doing 6d6 Hit Points of fire damage, and 6d6 Hit Points of cold damage to the target and any creatures caught in the area of effect.  This spell increases in strength with the casters level, doing an additional 2d6 Hit Dice each for every four levels of the caster, up to a maximum of 12d6 each at level 24. Creatures failing their Saving Throws each suffer full damage from the blast. Those who roll successful Saving Throws are nimble enough to dodge or take cover at the last moment, only taking half of the damage.~

Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: Special

When this spell is cast, the wizard opens a portal to the plane of fire in the sky above the battlefield, and pulls down a vortex of intense flames and super-heated air.  The swirling mass of fire touches down to the earth, then moves about unpredictably, scorching any creatures in it's path. The caster is immune to <PRO_HISHER> own spell, but <PRO_HISHER> companions are not, and must be wary.  If a creature is caught in the path of the burning vortex, it takes 8d8 fire damage, increasing by one point of damage per level of the caster, up to a maximum of 8d8+12.  Creatures may make a Saving Throw vs. Breath to halve the damage, but they must do so with a -6 penalty.  There is a 10% chance that affected creatures will be instantly incinerated to death, with no Saving Throw allowed.  A maximum of 6 creatures can be affected, after which the vortex will dissipate back into the fire plane.  Creatures immune to fire are not affected by this spell.~

When this spell is cast, the druid draws forth a globule of viscous, caustic slime, which is then hurled towards a creature of the druid's choosing.  When struck by the slime, creatures suffer 1d3+2 Hit Points of acid damage, and their resistance to all forms of physical damage is lowered by 3 percent for one round.  For every 3 levels of experience of the caster, an additional globule is added to the volley, up to a maximum of 7 at level 24.  There is no Saving Throw allowed for the effects of this spell.~

(Conjuration, Shadow)

Range: 40 ft.
Duration: 1 turn
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: 10-ft. radius
Saving Throw: None

When the priest chants this spell, a swirling misama of living shadow blankets an area of the caster's choosing.  Creatures caught in the maw of this hungering mass suffer 2d4 Hit Points of cold and 2d4 Hit Points of magic damage per round while they are in the area of effect, their level of fatigue increased by one, and must make a Saving Throw or also be held for one round and drained of two levels permanently.  The Saving throw against being held must be made at a penatly of -8, and -2 for being drained.  The caster and undead creatures are immune to the effects of this spell.  This spell may not be cast by clerics of good alignment.~
@3074 = ~Ko'Dezza's Frozen Death~
@3075 = ~Ko'Dezza's Frozen Death
(Evocation)

Level: 9
Range: 40 ft.
Duration: Instant
Casting Time: 6
Area of Effect: 15-ft. radius
Saving Throw: none

The first scroll containing this spell was discovered when a group of adventurers happened across a blasted hovel deep within the Spine of the World.  Under the remains lay a small laboratory that had apparently suffered a major magical mishap.  The scroll was firmly in the grasp of a necrotic, yet seemingly permanently frozen half-drowish hand.  It would be Ko'Dezza's final work, and her doom as well.  When cast, the wizard channels a massive amount of dark energy from the heart of the shadow plane into a singular point on the battlefield until it reaches critical mass, then explodes violently outward in all directions, ripping through any creatures in it's path, causing 7d10 Hit Points of cold damage and 7d10 Hit Points of magic damage.  There is a small chance that a creature hit by this dark energy will unwittingly become a conduit for a shadow elemental to enter the prime, resulting in their evisceration upon it's arrival.  The enraged elemental will attack the nearest creature, both friend and foe alike, until it is utterly destroyed.  There is no Saving Throw allowed for any of the effects of this spell.  Undead creatures are immune to the effects of this spell.~
@3076 = ~Conjure Shadow Elemental~
@3077 = ~Conjure Shadow Elemental
(Conjuration/Summoning)

Level: 6
Sphere: Elemental (Shadow), Summoning
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: 1 turn/level
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

Upon casting a Conjure Shadow Elemental spell, the caster opens a special gate to the Plane of Shadow, and a shadow elemental is summoned in the vicinity of the caster. There is a 60% chance that a 12-Hit-Dice elemental appears; a 35% chance that a 16-Hit-Dice elemental appears; and a 5% chance that a 24-Hit-Dice elemental appears. The elemental will do the bidding of the caster until it is slain or the duration of the spell runs out. All the commands given to the elemental are done telepathically, so there is no time lost due to miscommunication and no need to know the language of the summoned creature. Unlike Mages, priests do not have to engage in a battle of the minds to control their elemental.  This spell may not be cast by clerics of good alignment.~

@80002 = ~*sniff* Before we go, please take this.  We had bought it as a gift for our son's next birthday, and I cannot bear to look at it any longer.  I hope it serves you well, or at least brings you a few coins.~

@80004 = ~For your exemplary service to our temple, it was liberated from a miscreant attempting to pose as one of our own. Wield it well.~
@80005 = ~Know that should you ever need, you are welcome in our troupe.~

@80009 = ~While not nearly enough of a reward for all that you have done for me, I found this on one of the majicked paladins unfortunately slain when you arrived. Please, take it.~
@80014 = ~And what if it was? It is not of my making. I myself was once a resident for a time. It tends to snag passing teleporting mages from time to time. I left my magics and gadgets and was able to use some minor incantations to escape. Passive resistance is more successful when the very ground seems to drag magic to it. The others might find their release if they lose the anger and attachment to their toys. Ah, I will not argue this with you, the place was not of my making. You have done well enough to earn this. Goodbye.~
@80015 = ~You return. You are proven capable, at least in this respect. Certainly you have the will to change your personal ways as well. We are square and fair, for the moment. I cannot guarantee that we will remain so, however, as your kind is to be scrutinized closely. Rather a nonexistent short-term memory as well, I'm afraid. You have done me a favor, now do yourself one. Behave yourself until you are of positive standing in the community, and take this, I've no longer any need for it. Begone.~
@80016 = ~You return. I cannot say I am totally pleased with that, but you have done me a service, nonetheless. You may live, but we are still not square and fair. Cross my path again and the deaths of my daughters will be the fuel that drives my anger! You wouldn't like me when I'm angry. For now, I am satisfied, but only for now.  Take this for your services and begone from my sight.~
